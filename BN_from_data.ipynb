In above CPD, the probability of a large banana being tasty is estimated at 0.833, because 5 out of 6 observed large bananas were tasty. Fine. But note that the probability of a small banana being tasty is estimated at 0.0, because we observed only one small banana and it happened to be not tasty. But that should hardly make us certain that small bananas aren’t tasty! We simply do not have enough observations to rely on the observed frequencies. If the observed data is not representative for the underlying distribution, ML estimations will be extremly far off.\n",

Even if the total sample size is very large, the fact that state counts are done conditionally for each parents configuration causes immense fragmentation. If a variable has 3 parents that can each take 10 states, then state counts will be done seperately for 10^3 = 1000 parents configurations. This makes MLE very fragile and unstable for learning Bayesian Network parameters. A way to mitigate MLE’s overfitting is Bayesian Parameter Estimation."
